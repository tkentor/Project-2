### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Your instructors will be grading you using this rubric.

For each criterion below, instructors will give you a score according to the following guidelines. "Ticking" all of the boxes for a criterion will earn a "meets expectations".

They will also assign a **Total Score**, to serve as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals. However, __the more important scores are the individual ones__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

| Score | Expectations |
| :---- | :----------- |
| **0** | _Does not meet expectations_ |
| **1** | _Meets expectactions_ |
| **2** | _Exceeds expectations_ |

## Project Workflow - Does not meet expectations

> Do try to get some of this added. You'll want to have it for your job search

##### How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?
- The `readme.md` file contains any necessary installation instructions

  > Definitely add this. You are going to want to have potential employers checking this out

- The `planning` folder contains:
  - a picture / screenshot of your ERD (up to date!)
  - a `wireframes` directory, which in turn contains at least 2 drawings or photos of wireframes and ERDs
  - a `user_stories.md` file, which in turn contains at least 7 user stories (or a link to a Trello board or equivalent)

> No planning directory. Also important to add to talk about when job searching

- A Github issue was submitted to the `project2` repository **by 11:00am on Friday, November 20<sup>th</sup>,** containing a link to a hosted video
- The video itself and/or the site on which it can be found contains a website or e-mail address through which the creator can be contacted
- The video is at least 3 minutes long, but **no more than** 5 minutes
- The video contains:
  - A description and demo of the app
  - A code sample explaining one thing of which the creator is proud
  - One thing the creator would do differently next time
  - The next feature the creator would like to implement

> No video - please be careful with submission requirements going forward. Slack me if you have questions

## Technical Requirements - Meets Expectations
##### How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?
- The app contains at least 2 models

> :+1: 3 models including user. Well done

- The app contains at least 1 association
- At least 1 model incorporates `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes

> :+1: CRUD on practices. Reflections a delete or edit function could be nice.

## Creativity / Interface - Exceeds expectations
##### How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?
- The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS

> Really great job here! At the core you had an app that demonstrated and practiced what we had be talking about in class over the previous week. Once you had the solid foundation, you added functionality to the front end to make it really engaging. Awesome!

- The app delivers something of value to the end user: it is not just a login button and an index page

> :+1: Definitely.

## Code Quality - Meets expectations
##### How able would an uninformed programmer be to reuse and extend your code?
- The code follows style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indenting, modularity, and semantic naming
- The code is commented only with what is necessary to document what is happening in the code

> Generally pretty could. Indentation is off in some places. Be careful with this for others and your own sake. Really simple bugs become hard to find when indenting is off.

- For any page, copying its source code as it appears in the **browser** and pasting it into the [W3 Validator](http://validator.w3.org) yields 0 errors

> HTML gets messy. Do make sure that the HTML produced by your templates validates

## Deployment and Functionality - Does not meet expectations
##### How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?
- Cursory use of the app by an uninformed user yields no errors that "break" it

> Used app smoothly, had a little trouble with the timer.

- The app is deployed to Heroku (or another hosting service)

> Did not find a hosted version. This is definitely something you want to do before adding it to your portfolio.

- The contents of the creator's Github repository is identical to that of the Heroku repository

> N/A

- The `URL` field of the Github repository contains a link to the deployed version of the app

> N/A
